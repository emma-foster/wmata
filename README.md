## Requirements
- Rust 2018

## Installation

### Cargo
```toml
wmata = "2.0.0"
```

## Usage

### Getting Started
```rust
use wmata::RailClient;

let client = RailClient::new(api_key);

let trains = client.next_trains()?;
```

### Design
wmata breaks the WMATA API into two components: `RailClient` and `BusClient`.

#### `RailClient`
Provides access to all MetroRail related endpoints.

#### `BusClient`
Provides access to all MetroBus related endpoints.

### Using `RailClient`
```rust
use wmata::RailClient;

let client = RailClient::new(api_key);

let trains = client.next_trains()?;
```

### Using `BusClient`
```rust
use wmata::BusClient;

let client = BusClient::new(api_key);

let routes = client.routes()?;
```

## Testing
Note that tests must currently be run with `--test-threads 1` in order to pass, due to using live data.

## Dependencies
- serde
- serde_json
- reqwest
