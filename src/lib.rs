//! wmata is a simple interface to the [WMATA](https://wmata.com)'s API.
//!
//! # Design
//! wmata provides two main interfaces: [`BusClient`] and [`RailClient`].
//!
//! ## [`BusClient`]
//! The interface to WMATA's MetroBus related methods
//!
//! ## [`RailClient`]
//! The interface to WMATA's MetroRail related methods
